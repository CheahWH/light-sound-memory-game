## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[https://www.w3schools.com/js/]
[https://www.the-art-of-web.com/javascript/creating-sounds/]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I was having trouble getting used to the syntax and style of HTML, CSS, and JS but reading up on the resources online really helped. As it was a refreshing experience for me to use three languages at the same time let alone create a project that utilizes the AudioContext library which I had to read up all about it because it was rather amusing. Certain parts of the Glitch platform were also tricky to navigate at first, especially the part where you have to submit the code through Glitch to GitHub which I eventually had to download my code onto my computer and then publish it using GitHub Desktop. I also didn't know that deleting my gif on my computer after inserting the link on my README file would make it inaccessible which I then had to re-record.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[How long does one web development project usually take to complete from start to finish? 
How much do I need to know and do I have to be proficient at to be a decent web developer? 
What are the best ways to improve my skills to become a web developer other than building personal projects? ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would definitely spend them on changing the user interface of the game as I would prefer a more attractive display. I would want to change the shapes, colors, and layout of the button as well as the fonts and style of the wordings. If I had more time, I would include more buttons and I also would like to add at least 3 levels of difficulty (for example: increasing the length of each game and the speed of the button being pressed) for this project for users that would like to be challenged! If possible, I would also want the user's high score to be recorded and saved so users would be more motivated to beat their high score!]
